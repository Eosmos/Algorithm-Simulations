## Color Palette

### Primary Colors
- **Primary Blue (#4285f4)**: Main brand color, used for primary interactive elements and key visual accents
- **Light Blue (#8bb4fa)**: For hover states and secondary elements
- **Dark Blue (#2c5cbd)**: For active states and emphasis

### Secondary Colors
- **Purple (#7c4dff)**: Secondary brand color, used for visual variety and accent elements
- **Light Purple (#ae94ff)**: For hover states on secondary elements
- **Dark Purple (#5c35cc)**: For active states on secondary elements

### Accent Colors
- **Cyan (#00c9ff)**: For highlighting important elements and calls to action
- **Light Cyan (#6edfff)**: For hover states on accent elements
- **Dark Cyan (#0099cc)**: For active states on accent elements

### Background Colors
- **Darkest Blue (#0c1428)**: Main application background
- **Dark Blue (#162a4a)**: Card and section backgrounds
- **Medium Blue (#1e3a66)**: Interactive elements and containers
- **Light Blue (#2a4980)**: Hover states for dark backgrounds

### Text Colors
- **Light Gray (#e1e7f5)**: Primary text on dark backgrounds
- **Muted Blue (#8a9ab0)**: Secondary text and less important information
- **White (#ffffff)**: Emphasized text and headings

### Semantic Colors
- **Green (#24b47e)**: Success states and positive indicators
- **Orange (#ff9d45)**: Warning states and caution indicators
- **Red (#ff6b6b)**: Error states and negative indicators
- **Light Blue (#64b5f6)**: Information and neutral notifications

### Gradients
- **Primary Gradient**: Linear gradient from #4285f4 to #7c4dff (135° angle)
- **Accent Gradient**: Linear gradient from #00c9ff to #ae94ff (135° angle)
- **Success Gradient**: Linear gradient from #24b47e to #2de2a3 (135° angle)

## Algorithm Category Color Coding

Each algorithm category should have a consistent color association:

- **Supervised Learning**: Primary Blue (#4285f4) and its variations
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Cyan (#00c9ff) and its variations
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Orange (#ff9d45) and its variations
- **Deep Learning**: Purple (#7c4dff) and its variations

## Design Principles

### Visual Hierarchy
- Use darker backgrounds for containers and lighter backgrounds for interactive elements
- Create depth with subtle shadows and translucent overlays
- Establish clear information hierarchy with size, weight, and color

### Typography
- Use clean, modern sans-serif fonts (Inter, Roboto, or similar)
- Create contrast with font weights rather than multiple font families
- Scale text appropriately with consistent heading sizes

### Spacing
- Apply consistent spacing throughout the interface
- Use multiples of 4px for all spacing values (4px, 8px, 16px, 24px, 32px, etc.)
- Increase spacing between distinct sections, reduce spacing between related elements

### Shape
- Use rounded corners (12px radius) for cards and containers
- Use smaller radius (8px) for buttons and interactive elements
- Create visual interest with occasional circular elements

### Iconography
- Use a consistent icon set (Font Awesome or similar)
- Apply the category color to icons when possible
- Keep icon styles consistent (either all filled, all outlined, or a purposeful mix)

## Algorithm Page Structure Guidelines

When designing an algorithm page, include these key elements:

1. **Header Section**
   - Algorithm name (prominent)
   - Category badge (color-coded)
   - Brief description (1-2 sentences)
   - Breadcrumb navigation

2. **Visual Section**
   - Algorithm visualization or diagram
   - Interactive elements where appropriate
   - Color-coded to match algorithm category

3. **Information Architecture**
   - Clear sections with descriptive headings
   - Progressive disclosure of complex information
   - Consistent placement of similar information across algorithm pages

4. **Interactive Elements**
   - Clearly distinguish interactive vs. static elements
   - Provide visual feedback on hover/active states
   - Group related controls together

5. **Responsiveness**
   - Design for both desktop and mobile experiences
   - Stack elements vertically on smaller screens
   - Maintain legibility of text and visuals at all screen sizes

By following this design system, all algorithm pages will maintain visual consistency while allowing for algorithm-specific presentation needs.
